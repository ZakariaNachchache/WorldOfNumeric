Working on this project was an incredibly rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply my skills to a concrete project,
from building scalable backend services to creating an interactive frontend interface.
I hope you enjoy exploring and using this project as much as I enjoyed developing it.

Installation 

To install and run the project, follow these steps:
 Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git ,
 then navigate to the project directory.
 Inside the `/backend` folder, create a .env file and add the variables provided on the email: MONGO_URI & JWT_SECRET=very_secure_secret.
 Next, install the dependencies for both the backend and frontend by running npm i in their respective directories.
 Once the dependencies are installed,
 Setup
 start the backend server using npm start in the /backend folder.
 Then, navigate to the /frontend folder and run npm run dev to start the frontend development server.
 To avoid CORS issues, run the proxy server by executing node corsProxy.js from the root of the /frontend directory.
 After completing these steps, the project will be ready to use. Enjoy!
